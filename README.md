## Reference

### Feature flags

Feature flags are used to enable/disable features in the application. They are defined in [config/environment.js](config/environment.js).

```javascript
// in config/environment.js
let ENV = {
  // Other configuration settings...
  features: {
    "new-feature": true, // Enable the 'new-feature' by default
    "beta-feature": false, // Disable the 'beta-feature' by default
  },
};
```

The configuration can be manually overridden by adding a query parameter to the URL:

- `?feature-new-feature=false` to disable the 'new-feature'
- `?feature-beta-feature=true` to enable the 'beta-feature'

The overriding will be saved in a cookie, so it will persist across page reloads. The cookie can be cleared by adding `?clear-feature-overrides=true` to the URL.

The feature flags can be used in the application by injecting the `features` service and calling the `isEnabled` method.

```javascript
import { inject as service } from "@ember/service";

export default class ExampleComponent extends Component {
  @service features;

  doSomething() {
    if (this.features.isEnabled("new-feature")) {
      // Implement the logic for the new feature
      console.log("New feature is enabled!");
    } else {
      // Implement the logic for the default behavior without the new feature
      console.log("New feature is disabled!");
    }
  }
}
```

Or in template files by using the `is-feature-enabled` helper:

```handlebars
{{#if (is-feature-enabled "new-feature")}}
  <p>New feature is enabled!</p>a
{{else}}
  <p>New feature is disabled!</p>
{{/if}}
```

### List of feature flags

| Name              | Description                        |
|-------------------|------------------------------------|
| edit-contact-data | Enable the edition of contact site |

## Releasing a new version

We use [`release-it`](https://github.com/release-it/release-it) to handle our release flow.

### Generating the changelog

We use [`lerna-changelog`](https://github.com/lerna/lerna-changelog) to generate a basic changelog based on the merged PRs. Make sure all relevant PRs have a label, otherwise they will not be included in the changelog.

> `lerna-changelog` requires a Github [personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token) to work properly.

The following command can be used to generate the changelog:

`GITHUB_AUTH=your-access-token npx lerna-changelog`

### Creating a new release

Simply run `GITHUB_AUTH=your-access-token npm run release` and follow the prompts.

> If you generated the changelog using lerna-changelog you can add it to the changelog file and add it to the staged changes when release-it asks if you want to commit the changes. This will ensure that the changelog change is part of the release commit.

After the new tag is created and pushed CI will take care of building the docker image.
