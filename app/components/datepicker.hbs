    inputmask.js has a bug that makes it throw an error in Chrome, when autocomplete feature is used: https://github.com/RobinHerbots/Inputmask/issues/2809
    That bug has been fixed, but the fix hasn't been released yet in a stable release.
    It also seems there is a second bug that probably needs to be fixed before we can revert this: https://github.com/RobinHerbots/Inputmask/issues/2832
